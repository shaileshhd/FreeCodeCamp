        We all have seen a character interacts with hologram virtual objects, Head Mount
Display (HMD) in sci-fi movies. Augmented Reality (AR) technology is improving over
the past couple of years which brings sci-fi tech to sci-based reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        AR is one of the
biggest technology trends right now, and it is only going to get bigger as AR-ready
smartphones and other devices become more accessible around the world which lets us
see the real-life environment right in front of us with a digital augmentation overlaid on it.
In other words, AR is a technology that augments the user's reality by blending the real
and digital world in a subtle which will provide the user with a unique experience. 
      </p>

        Technology has advanced to the point where realism in virtual reality is very
achievable. One must capture the imagination to create truly compelling experiences. On
the spectrum between virtual reality, which creates immersible, computer-generated
environments, and the real world, augmented reality is closer to the real world. It is
important to determine the current situation of AR, used in various sectors and divided
into various applications, software, hardware, and to predict the future developments that
can be experienced.

      <p>
        In this century, where information and communication technologies
(ICT) affect every aspect of the lives of individuals, AR is one of the most attractive and
popular ones of these technologies and the way it will affect our lives and educational
experiences is unclear. Especially in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AR)
sectors, the growth of AR is rapid in recent years.

        This revolutionized AR tech is beneficial for construction, architects, designers, and
        project management. AR in construction makes it possible to combine virtual
        architectural designs with the physical reality of a job site. AR increases accuracy and
        efficiency by reducing errors related to managing time, money, and resources.

        There are
        several applications of AR in the Architecture, Engineering, and construction (AEC)
        industries. We have discussed a few in this article like AR in civil engineering, AR
        measure tape, and basic survey using AR.

        Need for AR

      <p>
        Physical-world is three-dimensional whereas most of the data is trapped on twodimensional pages and screens. This gulf between the real and digital worlds prevents us
        from fully exploiting the volumes of information now available to us. Augmented reality,
        a set of technologies that superimposes digital data and images on physical objects and
        environments is closing this gap.

      <div class="code">
        <code>
          var factor = CurrentDistance / InitialDistance;
        </code>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        By merging information directly into the context in
        which we will apply it, AR increases our ability to absorb and act on it. Augmented
        Reality improves how users visualize information, receive, and follow instructions, and
        interact with products.
